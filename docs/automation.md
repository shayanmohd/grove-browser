# Local automation

Kamapathy exposes a local HTTP API for scripts and external agents. It supplies browser tools and a human handoff mechanism. It does not bundle an AI model or autonomously plan tasks.

## Connect

Agents connect automatically. While agent access is on in **Settings**, under Agents (the default), the desktop app listens on a local socket in the profile's private agent folder, or on a named pipe with a new random name on Windows. The bundled client finds it with no token or setup, and starts Kamapathy when it is not running and access was left on. Turning agent access off stops the socket, and the client never starts Kamapathy against that choice. The web preview has no local automation server.

Each profile has its own agent folder, `agent` inside Kamapathy's application data folder. Set `KAMAPATHY_USER_DATA` to reach a different profile. The folder records the socket's location and a random instance value, whether access is off, and how to start this Kamapathy again. Every response carries the instance in `X-Kamapathy-Instance`, and the client confirms it with `GET /health`, which never waits behind page actions, before sending a command. Automatic starts run only a recorded program that no other account could have replaced, and never reopen debugging ports. See the skill's [connection reference](../skills/kamapathy/references/connection.md) for failures.

The bundled CLI uses Node.js built-ins and runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux:

```sh
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs health
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs space create "Documentation research"
```

Copy the returned space ID, then open a page and copy its tab ID:

```sh
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs open <space-id> https://example.com
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs snapshot <tab-id>
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs screenshot <tab-id> ./example.png
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs handoff <space-id>
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs resume <space-id>
```

Angle bracket IDs in examples are placeholders to replace with actual IDs. New spaces and tabs open in the background, preserving your current browsing selection. Screenshot files use exclusive creation so an existing file is never overwritten.

## Interact with a page

A snapshot contains the page's URL, title, visible text, and controls with labels, CSS selectors, and short element references such as `@e1`, read through open shadow roots and same-origin frames. Hidden, inert, transparent, and closed disclosure content is excluded. Text inside `aria-hidden` is included when it is rendered: the attribute hides content from assistive technology, not from the screen, and component libraries such as Google's Angular components put visible field labels and questions there. Icon font names such as `arrow_drop_down` are left out of text and labels. Controls under `aria-hidden` stay excluded, because pages hide what sits behind an open modal or menu that way. File-input metadata is an exception: an input hidden inside visible upload UI can expose a ref, accepted types, and its multiple-selection flag, without exposing selected files. Select controls include option labels, exact values, disabled states, and which options are selected: up to 20 options per select and 100 per snapshot, omitting values longer than 256 characters and setting `truncated` when options are omitted. Scope a select to avoid the shared option budget. Compact mode is the default: 4,000 text characters, 40 controls, and 80-character labels. Full mode raises the defaults to 24,000 text characters, 100 controls, and 200-character labels. Both modes retain the same JSON response shape and a `truncated` flag.

Controls include native links, buttons, fields, and disclosures; elements with the ARIA roles people operate directly, such as `option`, `listbox`, `menuitem`, `tab`, `switch`, `textbox`, `slider`, and `treeitem`; popup triggers with `aria-haspopup`; draggable elements; and custom elements that take keyboard focus. A wrapper that only holds other controls, such as a tree row drawn as a button around its tree item with no text of its own, and a list of options, are listed through the controls inside them. A checkbox, radio button, or switch drawn inside an option, menu item, tab, or tree item is part of that item; other controls inside one, such as a tab's close button or a tree item's expand button, are listed. Up to 30 elements that a page draws as clickable or draggable, with a pointer, grab, or move cursor and their own short text, are listed after every other control. A label comes from `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, a label element, a placeholder, the control's own text without icons marked `aria-hidden`, or its `title`. A field with none of these takes the text of the nearest container that holds no other control.

Each control can carry its state and value, in fields that appear only when they apply. `checked` is `true`, `false`, or `"mixed"`; `selected`, `expanded`, and `pressed` report the ARIA and native states. `value` is the current value of a text-like input, textarea, single select, contenteditable region, ARIA slider or spin button, or the choice a custom select shows without the options of a list open inside it, bounded to the label length; `valueTruncated` marks a shortened value. Password inputs, fields whose `autocomplete` is `current-password`, `new-password`, `one-time-code`, or any `cc-` token, and fields masked by `-webkit-text-security` report `valueHidden: true` instead of any value they hold. Radio buttons and checkboxes carry `group`, the question they answer: a fieldset legend, the name of a `radiogroup` or `group`, or the text before the choices when the group has no name. Radio buttons that share a name form a group even without a container. Text that a website echoes elsewhere remains visible, so snapshots are not a secret-redaction service.

When a page has more controls than the budget, the snapshot lists controls inside open dialogs, popups, listboxes, and menus first, then controls on screen inside fixed or sticky bars, then the rest of the screen, then controls on screen inside tall pinned columns, then everything else, and keeps the list in page order. A pinned box is a bar, such as a header, a banner, or the action bar at the bottom of a form, when it is at most a third of the viewport tall or at least two thirds as wide. A taller, narrower one, such as a navigation sidebar or a table of contents, is the same on every page, so the page beside it comes first. `omittedControls` counts the controls left out, and the CLI says how many more exist. Scope with `--selector` to list them.

Text and controls inside an open shadow root appear where the page draws them, in the order a person sees them, with slotted content where its slot is; labels, `aria-labelledby`, and refs resolve inside the shadow root. Text and controls inside a same-origin iframe appear where the frame sits in the page, nested frames included. Each control inside a frame carries `frame`, the index path of its frame among the frames of the document around it, such as `"0"` or `"0/1"`. Clicks and drags add the position of every frame around the control, fill and key presses act in the frame's document, and waits and scoped snapshots search the top document first, then frames depth first; a selector must still match exactly once across all of them. CSS selectors do not enter shadow roots. A frame from another origin, such as a payment form or an embedded map, is listed as a control with `role: "iframe"`, `crossOrigin: true`, and a label from its title, name, or host, so an agent knows content exists that Kamapathy cannot read. Any action on it fails with `409 cross_origin_frame`; ask the person to continue there. Closed shadow roots, PDF documents, and canvas interfaces stay out of reach.

Prefer compact snapshots, scoped snapshots, and element references for short agent conversations. A scoped snapshot observes one uniquely matching CSS selector, such as `form` or `#checkout`. Set `maxChars: 0` for controls only or `maxControls: 0` for text only. Explicit bounds are 0 to 24,000 text characters and 0 to 100 controls. Scope and bounds constrain the result; they do not grant access to other tabs or spaces.

```sh
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs snapshot <tab-id>
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs snapshot <tab-id> --selector '#search-form' --max-chars 1000
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs snapshot <tab-id> --full --json
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs click <tab-id> @e2
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs press <tab-id> Enter
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs drag <tab-id> @e4 @e7
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs scroll <tab-id> down 600 @e9
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs navigate <tab-id> https://example.com
```

Element references remain stable while the same document and element remain available. Pages often draw a control again after an input, for example a Save button that becomes enabled once a field changes. When a reference's element is gone, Kamapathy looks for the control drawn in its place: an element with the same tag, role, type, label, group question, and surrounding text as when a snapshot last listed it, on the same URL, that no current reference holds. It prefers the element at the same position in the page, and otherwise accepts exactly one match among at most 2,000 elements of the same kind. A control that looked like another visible control when a snapshot listed it, such as the Remove buttons of two rows with the same name, is never re-bound, because Kamapathy cannot tell which one the reference meant. The action reports the reference in `rebound`, and the reference points to the new element from then on. When nothing matches, or more than one element does, the reference fails with `stale_ref`. References never follow a control across a navigation or a change of URL, and file inputs are never re-bound. References also expire when the API restarts or when the bounded reference cache expires. Take a new snapshot after navigation or a stale-reference error. CSS selectors remain supported for compatibility and must uniquely match.

Clicks require a visible, enabled element and verify that another element does not cover its center. Kamapathy sends fixed native Chromium mouse events to the target tab without selecting that tab or focusing the application. A control drawn with no size, such as a radio button inside a list row that takes the row's clicks, has no point to press. Kamapathy then clicks it in the page with a DOM click, which the page sees as an untrusted event, and reports `fallback: "dom_click"`. It does this only when the nearest box around the control is on screen and uncovered; otherwise the click fails as covered or outside the viewport. This supports normal form validation and submission. URL-encoded and multipart forms targeting `_blank` preserve their POST body and referrer in a new tab in the same space. Use `tabs SPACE_ID` to discover that tab, then verify its receipt; the submitting tab does not navigate. Click and key actions briefly allow immediate navigation to start, then wait for its load; use an explicit wait condition for a later asynchronous outcome. Chromium discards native input that reaches a page before it renders its first frame after a navigation, and reports that dispatch as successful, so Kamapathy confirms that the page received each click and key press. Input that provably never reached the page is repeated after a rendered frame; input that never arrives fails with `input_not_delivered`. Input that reached the page is never repeated, and no other action is retried automatically.

Fill supports text, search, telephone, URL, email, password, number, date, time, datetime-local, month, and week inputs; textareas; single selects by exact option value; and contenteditable text. Chromium must accept an input value without normalization. Multiple selects, duplicate option values, disabled options or option groups, range inputs, and color inputs fail explicitly. Controls are rechecked after focus handlers run. It focuses the element within its page and dispatches input and change events. File uploads, checkbox values, and radio values are not accepted by fill. Use click for checkboxes and radios. Keyboard input supports Enter, Tab, Escape, Backspace, Delete, ArrowUp, ArrowDown, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, and Space. It can optionally target a ref or selector first. Modifier combinations, shell shortcuts, and arbitrary key sequences are not accepted.

Drag presses the mouse on the center of a source element, moves in steps past the distance pages wait for before a drag starts, and releases on the center of a target element, all with native Chromium mouse events. Source and target are each a ref or a unique selector. Both must be visible, the source enabled, and the target outside the source. Kamapathy scrolls the source into view, and the target when it is off screen. It fails with `drag_out_of_view` when both cannot be on screen together, and with `element_obscured` when another element covers either center. When the page starts an HTML drag, Kamapathy intercepts it before Chromium starts an operating system drag, moves it with drag events that carry the data the page set, and drops it on the target, as Playwright does. The result reports `drag: "html5"` or `drag: "mouse"`. A drag the page starts but Kamapathy never receives fails with `drag_not_delivered` after the mouse is released. If the person takes over during an HTML drag, Kamapathy cancels it instead of dropping.

Field values go through standard input, keeping them out of process arguments. The CLI preserves input exactly, including trailing newlines. For a nonsensitive sample value:

```sh
node -e "process.stdout.write('browser architecture')" | node scripts/kamapathy.mjs fill <tab-id> '#search' --stdin
```

For sensitive values, pipe from an appropriate local secret source. The API accepts up to 16,384 characters per field, 2,048 characters per selector, and 64 KiB per normal request body. The dedicated upload route has the larger bound described below.

## Select files for upload

`upload TAB_ID REF file [files]` selects local files on a current file-input ref from a snapshot. For example, after observing `@e8` on the intended upload form and confirming that the file and destination are authorized:

```sh
node scripts/kamapathy.mjs upload TAB_ID @e8 ./report.pdf
```

Replace the example ID, ref, and path with the actual values. Upload accepts only a ref, not a CSS selector or the surrounding upload button. The input must be visible, or hidden with a visible immediate parent, and outside inert or aria-hidden UI. It must belong to the current top document. Disabled inputs and directory selection are rejected. The input's single/multiple setting and accepted extensions or MIME types are checked before selection.

The standalone command accepts 1 to 8 regular files, at most 16 MiB in total. It is not available inside a batch. The client reads the selected files locally and sends their basenames, MIME types, and base64 bytes through the local agent socket. The API receives bytes in memory and does not read arbitrary paths from the browser machine. Keep private local paths and file contents out of page fields, prompts, and public logs.

The server permits one file transfer at a time and checks ownership before receiving the body and again before applying it. Navigation during transfer invalidates the operation. Only `POST /tabs/:id/upload` accepts up to 24 MiB of JSON to accommodate base64 encoding; the 64 KiB bound remains in place for all other routes. Its body is `{ "ref": "@e8", "files": [{ "name": "report.pdf", "type": "application/pdf", "data": "<base64 bytes>" }] }`. Use the CLI to encode files rather than placing their content in agent prompts.

Selection sets the input's files and dispatches input and change events. A site can begin uploading immediately, so the user's authorization must cover transmission before running the command. The response `{ "ok": true, "selected": 1 }` confirms selection, not server acceptance or publication. Inspect the site's progress and final receipt before continuing. After a timeout or error, check whether the site already received the files before retrying or submitting again.

This action does not open a native file chooser or expose native file handles. Sites that require those mechanisms or trusted chooser events may reject it. It does not add directory upload support.

## Batch a short interaction

`POST /tabs/:id/actions` accepts 1 to 20 fixed actions. The server validates the entire plan before running the first step, then executes in order with an ownership check at every step. Successful responses have `{ ok: true, results: [{ index, type, result }] }`. A failure returns the applicable HTTP error status and `{ ok: false, results, failedIndex, error: { code, message } }`. `results` contains completed steps; later steps do not run. If human takeover interrupts the batch, earlier observation contents are withheld.

The CLI reads a batch from standard input, either as an actions array or an object containing `actions`. For example, save this nonsensitive plan to a local JSON file, then run `node scripts/kamapathy.mjs batch <tab-id> < plan.json` in a shell supporting input redirection:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "type": "fill", "ref": "@e1", "value": "browser architecture" },
    { "type": "click", "ref": "@e2" },
    { "type": "wait", "selector": "#results", "timeoutMs": 5000 },
    {
      "type": "snapshot",
      "selector": "#results",
      "maxChars": 1600,
      "maxControls": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

Use references from your latest snapshot, not the example references verbatim. On PowerShell, pipe file contents with `Get-Content -Raw plan.json | node scripts/kamapathy.mjs batch <tab-id>`. Do not store secrets in a plan file. Submission must still be authorized by the user before a plan is sent.

Wait observes a uniquely matching visible selector, literal page text, or both. Like snapshot text, it counts rendered content inside `aria-hidden` as visible. With both, text is checked inside the selected element. The default timeout is 5,000 ms; explicit values range from 0 to 15,000 ms. Zero performs one check with at most 250 ms for the page response. Other wait deadlines include loading and page evaluation. With no condition, wait checks that the document is interactive or complete. Scroll moves up, down, left, or right by 1 to 2,000 pixels, defaulting to 600. With a ref or selector, it scrolls that element, or the nearest element around it that can scroll that way, and otherwise the page. Without one, it scrolls the page, or, when the page cannot scroll that way, the scrollable panel under the center of the viewport, as in apps whose content scrolls inside a fixed frame. A page whose overflow keeps a person from scrolling it, such as the page behind a modal that locks scrolling, never moves. The result reports `scrolled` (`"page"` or `"element"`), the element's `selector`, the new `x` and `y` offsets of what scrolled, and `moved`, which is false when nothing could scroll further.

Batch execution has a total 60-second budget. A failure is not a rollback, and a timeout does not prove that an input or form submission was cancelled. Inspect the outcome before retrying a consequential action. A batch reduces request overhead; it does not grant an agent permission to submit forms or send messages.

## Human handoff

`handoff` changes the space owner to human, as does choosing **Take over** in Kamapathy. While under human control, the API cannot inspect, navigate, capture, modify, or delete that space or its tabs, and those requests return HTTP 409 with `human_control`. The space remains visible in `GET /spaces` with `owner: "human"`.

Control returns to the agent in two ways. The person can choose **Let agent continue** in the bar under the agent space's page, or in the Spaces menu, or the agent can take control back with `resume`. `resume` changes the owner to agent and records an activity entry saying the agent took control back. It works on any agent space the running API server created or was granted, including one the person took over. A resume sent while the agent already has control changes nothing, and if the person takes over before that request runs, it returns `human_control` instead of taking the space back. It cannot reach personal spaces, agent spaces never granted to the running server, or spaces from an earlier server session.

Agents should take control back once the reason for the handoff is finished, for example when the person says they have signed in or asks the agent to continue. They should not take a space back while the person is still working in it, or after the person took it over to stop the agent, unless the person asks. The page may have changed, so take a new snapshot after resuming.

Turning agent access off in Settings remains the hard stop. It stops the server and refuses every request, including `resume`. Turning access on again starts a server that does not reclaim earlier spaces until you grant them again.

Taking over blocks subsequent automation operations and prevents pending snapshot results from being returned. It cannot undo a click, navigation, or form submission already dispatched. Agent browsing has side effects like normal browsing, so external agents should still follow their user's instructions before submitting forms or sending messages.

## HTTP routes

Requests are HTTP over the local agent socket. POST requests require `Content-Type: application/json`, including handoff and resume with `{}`. Responses are JSON except screenshots. Errors have the shape `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`.

Screenshots require a shown, unminimized Kamapathy window, including captures of background tabs. If the native window is hidden or minimized, the screenshot route returns HTTP 409 with `screenshot_unavailable`. Restore the window before retrying a capture, or use a snapshot when it provides enough information. This restriction applies to screenshots; it does not disable the space's other authorized actions.

Navigation accepts only complete HTTP or HTTPS URLs without embedded credentials. Paths do not accept query strings or encoded segments. The server limits its managed spaces to 12, tabs to 20 per space, and concurrent pending requests to 16. Page operations wait up to 15 seconds for loading and another 15 seconds for a response. A timeout does not guarantee a page action was cancelled; inspect the page before retrying a consequential action.

## Isolation and limitations

- The server listens only on a Unix socket in a private directory, or a Windows named pipe, never on a network port. Browsers cannot open either, and it also rejects Origin and Sec-Fetch-Site headers. There is no CORS access.
- There is no token. Any program running under your account can use the API while agent access is on; other accounts cannot open the socket. This is the same boundary as other local developer tools, and it is not a defense against an already compromised account. Turn agent access off in Settings to refuse all agents.
- Spaces created through the current API server are accessible. A space created in the interface starts under human control; choose **Let agent continue** to grant the running API access to it. Personal spaces remain outside its authority. Restarting the API does not reclaim older spaces unless you explicitly grant access again.
- Each agent space uses its own temporary browser session. Personal cookies and login state are not shared. Log into websites inside the agent space if needed. Agent browsing is excluded from persisted browser session, history, and activity state.
- Page observation and DOM preparation run fixed functions in an [Electron isolated JavaScript world](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-contents#contentsexecutejavascriptinisolatedworldworldid-scripts-usergesture). Native clicks, keys, and drags use only fixed internal Chromium input and drag interception commands. There is no arbitrary JavaScript, CDP, Node.js, shell, filesystem, or browser-wide debugging endpoint. Native input reports a conflict if developer tools are already attached to the tab.
- Snapshots are bounded DOM summaries, not accessibility tree exports. They read through open shadow roots and same-origin frames, list a frame from another origin without reading it, and do not enter closed shadow roots, PDF documents, or canvas interfaces. Screenshots capture the viewport, not the full scrolling page. JavaScript alert, confirm, and prompt dialogs have no automation action and may block a pending page action. Use human handoff to resolve them. Site compatibility varies.
- Kamapathy does not implement Playwright or Chrome DevTools Protocol compatibility, an MCP server, scheduling, model inference, or a built-in agent runtime. Use the documented HTTP routes or CLI from your own automation program.
- Agent spaces deny browser permission requests and downloads, including while under human control.
- Activity records describe operations without recording filled values. Page content is untrusted data and should not be treated as instructions by an external agent.
- File selection is limited to the documented upload route. It transfers supplied bytes into a file input, can trigger an immediate site upload, and returns a selected-file count. Activity records do not include file contents or local paths. File selection does not bypass a site's validation or establish that an upload succeeded.
